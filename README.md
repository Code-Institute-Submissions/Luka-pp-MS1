## Who is this website for?

This is a recruitment company website. It is designed and created in a simple way to connect Employers
and Employees. Oracle Recruitment serves as a mediary to provide a perfect connection in between the candidates
and their employers. Company is based in co. Kildare but serves the whole Republic of Ireland.

## The owner

The owner of the website is a holding company P&L Oracle Limited. The goals of the owner is to match as many
employees with their new employers and vice versa. 

## What does it do?

The website serves as a connection hub in between employers and employees. It helps employees to find the job and
employers to find their staff. It connects the user with recruitment agent, who then selects the suitable course of action.
The company also provides psychometric testings for the candidates, which is useful for future employers.
In case an employer wants to do the psychometric testing for one of their candidate, agent can also perform this task 
together with the external testing company.

## Testing 

### Browser Testing

Website has been tested in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Firefox and Opera. 

It was tested on two mobile devices OnePlus and Apple Iphone. Both thsts confirmed that website works great.

On each browser the website works as inteded visually and all the functionality of the website works as intended.



### Validators

The website has been through W3C Jigsaw validation with 2 errors. 
The errors are located inside bootstrap CDN and I have no control over it.
* URI : https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootswatch/4.5.2/sandstone/bootstrap.min.css
* 12	abbr[title], abbr[data-original-title]	Property text-decoration-skip-ink doesn't exist : none
* 12	.accordion	Property overflow-anchor doesn't exist : none

Website has been through W3C HTML Validator and there is no issues to report.


### Local Testing

Local testing of all the buttons, links and functionality of the website has been carried out.
There was few links which needed to be fixed and that was done. 

While testing forms I have discovered that all the fields are not being focused on when clicked. 
That has been fixed by matching ID in label and in input lines.

Hamburger toggler button was not centered and that was fixed by adding some additional CSS to it.

### Responsiveness

I used Google Chrome Dev Tools to check the responsiveness of website. Mobile, tablet and desktop sizes were tested and all worked well. 
It also responded on each breakpoint that were set up on Media Query's and no visual or functional errors found

##### Issue

Bigest issue that i have encountered was the responsivenes of the carousel images. The images look perfact (as intended) on mobile and on tablet screens.
The issue is happening with desktop and large deskrtop screens where images might look a bit streched. 
This project was focused on mobile first design so the images look perfect on mobile and medium devices. I have made sure that they are acceptable on large and extra large screens.

## Version Control

### Git & GitHub

I used **[GitPod](https://gitpod.io/)** as a local repository and IDE and **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** as a remote repository. The process of version control was:

* First i created a new repository on GitHub 
* I have then opened that repository on GitPod and started coding
* In GitPod i have created all the pages and and folders 
* I was then saving my work and pushing it to GitHub repository to keep it safe
* Process for saving, commiting and pushing it to remote repository goes as follows (done in terminal):
*   * git add . / for adding work to git
    * git commit -m "Commit message" / to commit the work on the stage
    * git push / to update work to GitHub

## Deployment

To deploy the website, I followed the below steps on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
1. Go to **"Settings"** on the repository
2. On **"Source"** of **"GitHub Pages"**, select **"master** for Branch and click save
3. The website is now published on GitHub Pages and the link is provided on on the same section


## Oracle recruitment

As one of the owners and directors of Oralce Recruitment company I will use this project as a starting point for the 
companies website. In the following lessons I will further expand on website's functionality and practical usage.
All the items listed as features left to implement will be inplemented in future and the website will be hosted on
our Digital Ocean server which currently hosts the Wordpress website for the company.
