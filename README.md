and their employers. Company is based in co. Kildare but serves the whole Republic of Ireland.

The owner of the website is a holding company P&L Oracle Limited. The goals of the owner is to match as manny
employees with their new employers and vice versa. It is also providing psychometric testings for the employers to further 
develop their staff.

## What does it do?

The website servesas a connection hub in between employers and employees. It helps employees to find the job and
