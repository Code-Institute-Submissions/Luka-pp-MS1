### Validators

The website has been through W3C Jigsaw validation wit 2 errors. 
The errors are located inside bootstrap CDN and I have no control over it.

* 12	abbr[title], abbr[data-original-title]	Property text-decoration-skip-ink doesn't exist : none
* 12	.accordion	Property overflow-anchor doesn't exist : none

Website has been through W3C HTML Validator and there is no issues to report.


### Local Testing

Local testing of all the buttons, links and functionality of the website has been carried out.
There was few links which needed to be fixed and that has been done. 

While testing forms I have discovered that all the fields are not being focused on when clicked. 
That has been fixed by matching ID in label and in input lines.

Hamburger toggler button was not centered and that was fixed by adding some additional CSS to it.

The deploymentof website has been carriedout via GitHub by following their instructions.

The website is deployed on GitHub Pages. and can be accesed via link [Here](https://luka-pp.github.io/MS1/)
